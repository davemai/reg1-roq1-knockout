## Bulk RNAseq analysis of Regnase-1 and/or Roquin-1 knockout primary human T cells
This repo describes analysis performed in the publication titled "Combined disruption of T cell inflammatory regulators Regnase-1 and Roquin-1 enhances antitumor activity of engineered human T cells".

### Bulk RNAseq data
Sample type: primary human T cells

Number of bio samples: 3
* sample 1: mesothelin-targeting CAR-T cells, donor ID # 539, 1 technical replicate
* sample 2: mesothelin-targeting CAR-T cells, donor ID # 561, 2 technical replicates
* sample 3: NY-ESO-1-targeting TCR-T cells, donor ID # 579, 2 technical replicates

Number of experimental groups per sample: 4
* Regnase-1 knockout (Reg1-KO)
* Roquin-1 knockout (Roq1-KO)
* Regnase-1 and Roquin-1 double knockout (DKO)
* No knockout (Mock)

Total samples = 20 (sample 1 * 4 groups * 1 rep + sample 2 * 4 groups * 2 reps + sample 3 * 4 groups * 2 reps)
